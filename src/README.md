The 'Batch' file contains proofs for several reaction types, including 1st order reversible, 2nd order irreversible, parallel, and series reactions, along with a Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. 
Additionally, the 'CSTR' folder  is dedicated to proofs derived from numerical solution for Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) setup.

Please explore each of these resources for further details on our proofing process and methodologies.
