# KeYmaeraX_Project
Every version of KeYmaera X can be accessed here https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaeraX-release/releases, although we specifically utilized version 5.0.2. To use it, first download the appropriate version, and then input the command 'java -jar keymaerax.jar' into the terminal. 
This project was executed using KeYmaera X, a dedicated theorem prover developed for hybrid systems. To utilize this platform, [Download KeYmaera X](https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaeraX-release/releases/download/5.0.2/keymaerax.jar) and initiate it by executing `java -jar keymaerax.jar` in your terminal. Following the initiation, you can load the necessary model by selecting the "New Model" button within the KeYmaera X interface. It is worth noting that our research specifically utilized version 5.0.2.
