# KeYmaeraX_Project
This project was executed using KeYmaera X, a dedicated theorem prover developed for hybrid systems. To utilize it, [Download KeYmaera X] (Once the application starts, load the desired model by clicking on the "New Model" button in the KeYmaera X interface.) and Launch KeYmaera X by entering the command `java -jar keymaerax.jar` into your terminal. Once the application starts, load the desired model by clicking on the "New Model" button in the KeYmaera X interface.
KeYmaera X has a comprehensive [documentation](https://keymaerax.org/) providing further information and user guidance. Explore it for a deeper understanding and more effective use of the theorem prover.
